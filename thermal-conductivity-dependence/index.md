Thermal conductivity depends on other properties of a medium.  For many media,

# Thermal Conductivity Depends on Temperature

the thermal conductivtiy changes with changing temperature.  In some cases
this dependency is strong and in other cases much weaker.  Also, there is
variation between media whose conductivity increases with temperature and
those that decrease with temperature.

# Thermal Conductivtiy Depends on Density/Porosity

As a material becomes less dense, especially due to porosity, its thermal
conductivity decreases.
