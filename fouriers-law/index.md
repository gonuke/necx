# Fourier's Law

Pure conduction of heat through a medium is described by Fourier's Law:

$$-k \vect{\nabla T} = \vect{q''}.$$

where

* $k$ describes the thermal conductivity of the medium,
* $\nabla T$ is the gradient in the temperature in that medium; this is a
  vector quantity, and
* $\vect{q''}$ is the heat flux; this is a vector quantity whose direction is
  defined by the temperature gradient.

The negative sign indicates that heat flows "down" a temperature gradient, or
from hot to cold.
