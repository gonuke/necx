# Units

The units of thermal conductivity are energy per unit time per unit distance
per unit temperature, or power per unit distance per unit temperature.  In SI,
this is usually given as:

$$\frac{J}{s\cdot m \cdot K} = \frac{W}{m\cdot K).$$

In English units, this could be given as:

$$\frac{BTU}{s\cdot ft \cdot F}.$$
