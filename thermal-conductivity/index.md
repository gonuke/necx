# Thermal Conductivity

Thermal conductivity is an intrinsic property of a material and describes how
easily heat passes through that medium.  Heat moves quickly through a medium
with high thermal conductivity and slowly through a medium with low thermal
conductivity.

Recalling that heat conduction is driven by a temperature difference, the same
temperature difference in two media with different thermal conductivities will
cause different rates of energy transfer.

Due to the close analogy between thermal conduction and electrical conduction,
there is also a close analogy between thermal conductivity and electrical
conductivity.  Media with low thermal conductivity are often referred to as
insulators.

The variable that is most commonly used to represent thermal conductivity is
$k$.
