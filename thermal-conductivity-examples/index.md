# Sample Conductivities

Among solids, metals generally have the highest thermal conductivities and
plastics and ceramics have the lower thermal conductivities.

## Table showing some sample thermal conductivities at room temperature (footnote)

<insert table here>

footnote: since thermal conductivity is a function of the temperature of the
medium, the values in this table are evaluated for ecah medium at room
temperature (25 $^o$C).
